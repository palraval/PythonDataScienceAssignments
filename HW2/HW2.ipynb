    "Many of you may have encountered the output of machine learning models which, when \"seeded\" with a small amount of text, produce a larger corpus of text which is expected to be similar or relevant to the seed text. For example, there's been a lot of buzz about the new [GPT-3 model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), related to its [carbon footprint](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem/#2781c1b16b43), [bigoted tendencies](https://medium.com/fair-bytes/how-biased-is-gpt-3-5b2b91f1177), and, yes, impressive (and often [humorous](https://aiweirdness.com/)) [ability to replicate human-like text in response to prompts.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/) \n",

    "We are not going to program a complicated deep learning model, but we will construct a much simpler language model that performs a similar task. Using tools like iteration and dictionaries, we will create a family of **Markov language models** for generating text. For the purposes of this assignment, an $n$-th order Markov model is a function that constructs a string of text one letter at a time, using only knowledge of the most recent $n$ letters. You can think of it as a writer with a \"memory\" of $n$ letters. \n"

Your function should then return this dictionary. \n",

    "Now we generate text one character at a time. To do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the most recent `n` characters in our generated text. Say that `n = 3` and the 3 most recent character are `the`. \n",

    "4. The final character of this new `n+1` gram is our next letter. \n",

    "For example, if there are 3 occurrences of `them`, 4 occurrences of `the `, and 1 occurrences of `thei` in the n-gram dictionary, then our next character is `m` with probabiliy 3/8, `[space]` with probability 1/2, and `i` with probability `1/8`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: the ***3rd***-order model requires you to compute ***4***-grams. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should do\n",

    "- `length`, the size of the text to generate. Use a default value of 100. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['One'] # output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second arguments must be lists of equal length. Note also that the return value is a list -- if you want the value *in* the list, you need to get it out via indexing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: For grading purposes, the `options` should be the possible `n+1`-grams in the order of first appeareance in the text. If you are working through the strings from beginning to end, you will not have issues with this, as dictionary keys are ordered. Please do NOT use [`random.seed()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_seed.asp) in your function -- the autograder code will do it. You are welcome to try it out in your notebook for reproducible results if you are interested. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: The first thing your function should do is call `count_ngrams` above to generate the required dictionary. Then, handle the logic described above in the main loop."
